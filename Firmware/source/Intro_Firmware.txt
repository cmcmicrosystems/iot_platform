Tools required
==============

1. Code Composer Studio ver 7.4.0 or above
2. Simplelink BLE_SDK Ver 2.2.0.31. (Use the same version of BLE_SDK stack as newer version will need code migration)
3. TI RTOS - Use the TI RTOS installation integrated in the BLE_SDK installation

Steps to Develop
=================
1. Install CCS, BLE_SDK in the default location of c:\ti
2. Open CCS and import the projects (both *_app & *_stack) to your workspace
3. Compile the stack project first
4. Compile the app project next
5. Program the MCU with stack project first and then app project, if you are debugging from CCS
6. If programming from Flash Programmer 2, you need to flash both app and stack simultaneously

Code Structure
===============
1. The directory contains two CCS project	
	BLEsensor_cc2650lp_app
	BLEsensor_cc2650lp_stack
2. Stack project holds only the BLE stack configuration. More details can be found in TI website
3. App project is based on TI example of "SimpleBroadCaster"
4. Each of the senor has a driver files *.h & *.c available in BSP_Drivers folder
		adxl362.h	--	Accelerometer driver header
		adxl362.c	--	Accelerometer driver source
		opt3001.h	--	Optical sensor driver header
		opt3001.c	--	Optical sensor driver source
		tmp100.h	--	Temperature sensor driver header
		tmp100.c	--	Temperature sensor driver source
		bspBoard.h	--	Sensor board pin mapping header
		bspBoard.c	--	Sensor board RTOS driver initialization
		Board.h		--	Top level board definition 
5. Application folder contains the main firmware application
		simple_broadcaster.h 	-- Header file for the application
		simple_broadcaster.c 	-- Source file for the application
