The Design flow used was KiCad v(5.1.9)-1 [Eeschema and Pcbnew].

Directories within IoT2021A_FabricationOutputs.zip
1) /Bill_of_Materials - Bill of Materials including special notes about 'do not place' and components CMC Microsystems would provide (including quantity)
2) /Drill_files
3) /plots and /plots_UsingProtelExtensions - both of these directories contain identical gerber files.  Use one of them.  
   3a) the file, IoT_2021A-Edge_Cuts.gbr provides the board outline.
4) /XY_position_files - XY/mirror coordinate data.
5) /KiCAD_Board_File - the KiCAD 5.1.9 Pcbnew pcb board file.

DRAWING VIEW
1) When AE1 (the Antennova RUFA Antenna) is in the top-right-corner, the view is of the FRONT side of the board.  (The coin-cell battery clip is on the bottom of the board, BACK side.)
2) Board Outline: In /plots directory, "IoT_2021A-Edge_Cuts.gbr"

DRILL (files in /Drill_files subdirectory)
1) Standard tolerance of +/- 2mils on finished hole diameter.
2) Plated Through Holes (PTH), two types. larger test points ('TPx') and smaller vias

   A) Test Points - marked as 'o' in map file, quantity 4 (two round pads, two square pads, circular drill hole) 
      a) toolsize=30 mils drill diameter - note the imperial drill size dimension.
      b) after plating, minimum allowable copper in PTH shall be 1 mil.

   B) Vias - marked as '*' in map file, quantity 127 
      a) toolsize=13 mils - note the imperial drill size dimension.
         A tolerance of -3mils off the 13mils toolsize (that is, down to 10mils drillsize) is acceptable to achieve the required annular ring width.
         ****Report chosen drill size****
      b) after plating, minimum allowable copper in via shall be 1 mil.
 
3) Component U1 (The CC2640 processor), has 5 vias-in-pad within the centre grounding pad, pad #33.  The vias are the same size as all other vias (with the exception of the test points).
4) Non-Plated through Holes (NPTH): none  The map ('*-NPTH-drl_map.pdf') and drill file ('*-NPTH.drl')are empty/blank for these.


LINE WIDTHS & CONTROLED IMPEDANCE MATCHING
1) Line width reduction due to pinholes, nicks, or line shrinkage 10% max on all controlled impedance lines.
2) On Layer 1 = Front = TOP, there are only 3 controlled impedance lines.  
   a) U1/Pin-1 to U4 Pin-4
   b) U1/Pin-1 to U4 Pin-3
   c) U4/Pin-1 to AE1 Pin-2 <<<Most important to hit 50 Ohms on this trace to the Antenna.
   A Graphic of the Antenna feed is in the Excel Stackup file, STACKUP_IoT2021A_ForFab.xlsx.
2) Layer 1 & 6 - 1/2 Oz Copper gold plated, hard.
3) All other layers, 1 Oz Copper.
4) The stackup is asymetrical.  Add copper fill on layer 4 to balance the layout <<<I need to do this.

PASTEMASK
1) Facility may adjust pastemask size. Report each change of pastemask size to the client. 

SOLDERMASK
1) Black on both sides
2) Soldermask opennings are 2.5mil but may be altered by the manufacturer.  Whenever convenient, report soldermask changes to client.

SILKSCREEN
1) WHITE, EPOXY OR ACRYLIC INK.

COMPONENTS
1) All components were chosen to be lead-free, ROHS compliant.
2) In Special Notes of BoM - CMC Microsystems will supply: 
    2a) 50x OPT3002DNPT (Digikey part number 296-44600-1-ND)
    2b) 24x CC2640F128RSMT (Digikey part number 296-41116-1-ND) (out of the 48 needed)
3) All remaining components, including the balance of CC2640 components, are to be supplied by the PCB Assembly facility.
